talk_title: Differential Properties and Twists of Block Ciphersâ€™ Sboxes
---
**Abstract**: Every design of a block cipher relies on one or multiple nonlinear features, commonly referred to as Sboxes, which must satisfy a plethora of cryptographic properties to counter many of the known attacks. These Sboxes admit n-bit inputs and have n-bit outputs, that is, they are, mathematically, just functions defined on a vector space of dimension n (either $F_2^n$, or $F_{2^n}$ ) over the binary field $F_2$.

In this talk, we concentrate on differential (and related) features of Sboxes and go through some of the properties, characterizations, constructions and recent twists as related to differential attacks on block ciphers.

**Bio**: Pantelimon Stanica is currently working as a Professor in the Department of Applied Mathematics, Graduate School of Engineering & Applied Sciences (GSEAS) at Naval Postgraduate School, Monterey, USA. He is also associated with the Institute of Mathematics of Romanian Academy as a researcher. He received his doctoral degree in mathematics from the State University of New York at Buffalo in 1998. He also received a doctorate in algebra from the Institute of Mathematics of the Romanian Academy in 1998. He has published over 150 research articles in internationally reputed journals and conferences and has co-authored a book on Cryptographic Boolean Functions (now in the second edition) and co-edited two conference proceedings. His research interests include number theory, cryptography, coding theory, combinatorics, finite fields, Boolean functions, valuation theory, class field theory, and theoretical computer science.
